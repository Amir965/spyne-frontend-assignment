TECHNICAL DECISIONS:
1.ReactJS: Chosen for its component-based architecture and ease of managing state.
2.Tailwind CSS: Selected for rapid styling with utility-first CSS.

TRADE-OFFS:
1.Complexity vs. Simplicity: Kept the design simple to meet the 4-hour time constraint.
2.Manual Timestamps: No automation for timestamps to keep the implementation straightforward.

FUTURE-IMPROVEMENTS:
1.Automated Captioning: Integrate speech-to-text for automated caption generation.
2.Enhanced UI/UX: Improve the UI with animations and better styling.
3.Advanced Error Handling: Add more robust error handling and validations.
